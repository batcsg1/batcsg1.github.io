# Batchelor-Monkey-Puzzle-Website
This website documents the fascinating journey of a dozen little Monkey Puzzle
seeds collected from a local New Zealand park, as they progress into seedlings. 

AlphaDev v1.0.5 - 13th August 2024
- Changed nav background colour from white to a light yellow on the main page (index.html)
- For all pages, the white text boxes that the paragraphs are in, now have inline margins applied to them so there is space between the webpage and the text boxes.
- For all the other pages except the main page, The about headers have been changed from black headers with no inline margins, to light green headers, with italic text, green borders and a bit of an inline margin.
- Removed all remaining instances of the former "p-background" class within paragraph elements, as the class was unecessary.
- Width of the website has been changed from an absoulte width of 800px to a relative width of 53em
