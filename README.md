# The Batchelor Monkey Puzzle Website
This website documents the fascinating journey of a dozen little Monkey Puzzle
seeds collected from a local New Zealand park, as they progress into seedlings. 

AlphaDev v1.0.9 - "JavaScript Genesis" Update - 23rd August 2024

ADDITION OF NEW RANDOM FACT BOX
- On the main page just below the nav menu that contains the buttons: "Contents", "About Me", "Extras", There is now a new feature that displays a random fact about the Monkey Puzzle tree each time the browser is loaded. The "nuts and bolts" of this feature were implemented using JavaScript, meaning AlphaDev v1.0.9 is offically the first version of the Batchelor Monkey Puzzle Website to use JavaScript.
