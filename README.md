# The Batchelor Monkey Puzzle Website
This website documents the fascinating journey of a dozen little Monkey Puzzle
seeds collected from a local New Zealand park, as they progress into seedlings. 

AlphaDev v1.2 "Spring Cleaning" update - 29th August 2024

MAIN HEADER
- The main header now consists of a recent photo of the 10 Batchelor Monkey Puzzle seedlings with the header text positioned in the center.
- The Random Monkey Puzzle fact generator is now contained within the section as well.

REMOVAL OF THE FRUTIGER AERO BACKDROP
- The light green gradient background has been replaced with a white background.
- The about headers on every page, e.g the one on the main page that says "About this website", are no longer contained within a green rounded-rectangle. Instead the headers are just green Segoue UI text with an underline.
- Every text box is no longer within a white rounded rectangle, and the font has changed from Segoue UI to Courier New

IMAGE CONTAINER ON CHINGFORD PAGE
- All four images have been properly centered within the container, and the text below is now properly beneath all 4 images.
