ADDITION OF NEW MONKEY PUZZLE AGE BUTTON

- Using Javascript and a bit of CSS, a new age button has been placed under the image container on the main page. Every time the button is clicked the age counter increments by one. And as soon as the button is clicked the age counter will display below it.

- When the user reaches 10 clicks (10 years), there will be a paragraph in a yellow text box that will pop up saying it takes 10 years for a Monkey Puzzle to reach grass height. Then after 10 clicks the paragraph will disappear

- Also when the user reaches 40 presses (40 years), the paragraph will reappear again stating that it takes 40 years for Monkey Puzzles to produce cones.

RE-ENGINEERING OF THE NAV MENU SYSTEM

- The nav menu at the top of the main webpage now consits of an unordered list containing "Contents" and "Extras" as list items and the "About Me" as a button within the unordered list.

- Fixed issue where whenever the user hovered over the "Extras" button, the buttons contents would always appear under the "Contents" button and would be stretched out to go underneath the "Contents" button.

ADDED OFFICAL WEBPAGE ICON
- On the website tab, directly left of the website title is a new offical icon for the website. The new icon features an old 1800's illustration of a young Monkey Puzzle tree.
