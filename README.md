This website documents the fascinating journey of a dozen little Monkey Puzzle
seeds collected from a local New Zealand park, as they progress into seedlings. 

AlphaDev v1.0.8 - "Going Green" Update - 22nd August 2024

NEW BACKGROUND
- Every page on the website now has the new white to green gradient background implemented, replacing the old white to blue gradient background.

"ABOUT THIS WEBSITE" SUBHEADER
- The "About this website" subheader on the main page has been updated to have the same styling as the subheaders in the other pages. The styling for all subheaders is black Segoue UI text wrapped in a white to green gradient text box with a green border.

MAIN WEBSITE HEADER AND PAGE HEADER ON EVERY PAGE
- Every page (other than the main page) now has the main "Batchelor Monkey Puzzle Website" header added with the page headers now classed as subheaders, that sit beneath the main header. Eg. The Chingford Park page has the main "Batchelor Monkey Puzzle Website" header with the page header directly below.
    - The page header contains black Franklin Gothic Medium text encapsualted within a white rounded rectangle.

TEXTBOX STYLE CHANGE
- Every text box has now had their font changed from black Arial font to dark grey Franklin Gothic Medium font to make the text more readable

- A new section has been added to the "First batch of seeds" page called "The first eight weeks" which contains two images featuring two of the Batchelor Monkey Puzzles. A new textbox has been added containing information about how the seedlings have progressed within the first eight weeks.
