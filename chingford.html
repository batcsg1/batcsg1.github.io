    <h1>Sunday June 9th, 2024 - Chingford Park</h1>

    <h3>Initial voyage to Chingford Park</h3>

    <p>
        It all started on a mildly wet winter's evening on Sunday the 9th of June 2024 at Chingford Park, 
        in the outskirts of the Dunedin suburb of North East Valley. When my family and I had arrived at Chingford Park, 
        we were graced by the vast openess of the Park grounds as well as the majestic stand of trees in the distance.
        I can recall when I was walking across the wide open park grounds, It was spitting very lightly at first. 
        Then as I approached closer to the stand of trees, the rainfall slowly started to wane. When I finally reached the grove of trees, 
        I got all these memories flooding in as I specifically remembered the types of trees that were there when my family and I last visited Chingford Park in 2021. 
        But there was one type of tree that I was hunting for in particular within the vast forest of trees at Chingford,
        which was the main reason for our winter expedition to Chingford Park. The tree I set my sights on was Aracauria aracuana,
        commonly known as the Monkey Puzzle Tree. The tree is native to the Andes Mountain Range along southern Chile, and also parts of Argentina. 
        What has always fascinated me about the Monkey Puzzle Tree, is its spiky scales/leaves that armour the trees branches and trunk. 
        I also admire the Monkey Puzzle for its distinctive symmetrical form when the tree is young, as it's branch whorls are usually evenly spaced between each other.

    <h3>Hunt for Monkey Puzzle Seeds</h3>

    <p>
        The main drive behind our mission to Chingford Park, was to collect and harvest any Monkey puzzle seeds lying on the ground. 
        Once finding some seeds, the plan was to take them home and try and grow them, to raise a few seedlings. At Chingford Park, there are two 100 year old 
        Monkey Puzzle trees, which are several feet away from each other, one male and one female. So to find the seeds, I had to search at the base of the female tree. 
        After countless minutes surveying the base of the female tree, we finally started to find one seed after the other. The seeds were torpedo shaped, and were reddish orange in color. 
        As I started to find a few more of these seeds, my family also decided to join in on the seed hunting expedition.

    <p>
        After finding 15 to 20 Monkey Puzzle seeds, I suddenly spotted something unusual under the low hanging branches of this short squat conifer, that was directly under the canopy of the female Monkey Puzzle. 
        After careful observation, to my amazement, what I had discovered was a little self-sown Monkey Puzzle seedling. Words can not explain the excitement I felt when finding that seedling. Because I thought to myself, 
        finding a self-sown Monkey Puzzle is a very unusual find. So when I had told my Dad about the finding, he decided to help me to try and dig out of the ground, using just his car key. Once we got it out of the ground, 
        it was transplanted into this orange-flavoured tic-tac container that my brother had found earlier at the park. When transplanting the tree, my dad filled the container up with soil to place the tree into. 
        Once we transplanted the wee Monkey Puzzle seedling, it was time to go home. Finding not only Monkey Puzzle seeds, but as well finding a self-sown Aracauria aracuana, made the trip to Chingford Park even more memorable, 
        and a trip to never forget.
