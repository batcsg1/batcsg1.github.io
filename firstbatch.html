        After the first the month, the seedlings are going along pretty well. 7 seeds out of the original
        9 from the first batch successfully germinated. As of the 12th of August, the seedlings are averaging 1 to 3cm tall.
        One of the seedlings had also developed two stems, which was very unusual. A sort of thing like this
        doesn't happen very often, especially during germination.
