    <h2 id = "about-header">About this Website</h2>

    <p id="txt-1">This website delves into the journey of a dozen Monkey Puzzle seeds that I had
        collected from a place called Chingford Park, located in the city of Dunedin in
        New Zealand. Since June 9th, 2024, I have been nuturing 7 little Monkey Puzzle seedlings
        that have sprouted out of a batch of 9 seeds from the original dozen from Chingford Park.
        And since August 4th, 2024, I decided to sow 4 more seeds, after 2 out of the original 9 seeds died.
