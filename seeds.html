        Approximately 19 days, after our initial winter excursion to Chingford Park, I was ready to sow 9 of the dozen monkey puzzle seeds I had collected there.
        As I selected 9 seeds, I placed 4 other seeds outside to get some cold stratification. The remaining seeds where ones that felt a bit soft, and not very firm. So I decided to throw those ones out, as they probably
        weren't very viable. Anyway, on a late and mildy wet Friday afternoon I was preparing the soil for the seeds, by mixing some native soil near this giant Karamu with some potting mix from a bag in our garage.
        After mixing the two together, I had crafted a rather coarse but not to much of a woody and barky mix. This mix was stored in a small lunch container, that my father has used in the past
        to create some of his potting mixes for his plants. After crafting the mix, I scooped some of it into this small green tray for my seeds to be sown in.       
        Then a few hours later after having dinner, I assorted the seeds I wanted to sow. Out of the dozen seeds I collected, I ended up choosing
        9 of them to sow. When selecting the seeds, I went for the firm and orange-ish seeds, as I knew they would have the most vigor and have the greatest chance of germinating.
        When I had selected the seeds, I went ahead and placed each one, one at a time three quarters of the way into the soil. And wola, just like that the journey of looking after and nuturing 
        these nine seeds had just begun.
